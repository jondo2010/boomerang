The Reactor assembly API for Boomerang. Builder is the API driven by code generated by `boomerang_macros` (e.g. `#[reactor]`, `reaction!`, and `timer!`).

The most important data structure for Builder is the [`EnvBuilder`], which also serves as the API entry-point. Once all
of the Reactors and Reactions have added their graph state into the [`EnvBuilder`], [`EnvBuilder::into_runtime_parts`]
is called to generate the data for the Runtime.

Most users will not need to interact with Builder directly, but for specialized cases it can be useful to manually build
reactors with [`EnvBuilder`] and [`ReactorBuilderState`], or to adjust the [`EnvBuilder`] graph after reactors have been built.
