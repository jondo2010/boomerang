# Writing Reactors

This section walks through writing Boomerang reactors using Rust macros. It focuses on the Rust-first API and builds up concepts in small steps.

If you are new to Boomerang, start with "A First Reactor" and then continue in order. Each page adds one new concept and links back to the core concepts section for definitions.

Topics that are not yet supported in Boomerang are called out explicitly rather than implied.
